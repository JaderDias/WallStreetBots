(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday it will not participate in person at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022 in Las Vegas, joining a list of companies opting not to have a physical presence at next month's event on concerns over the rapid spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.

The U.S. software giant added that it will continue to participate at CES remotely, according to an emailed statement. The Verge was the first to report on Friday that Microsoft will not participate physically AT CES.

Several other companies including U.S. automaker General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and its self-driving auto-technology company Waymo, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc, Twitter Inc, Lenovo Group, AT&T Inc and Amazon.com Inc dropped in-person attendance plans earlier this week.

CES officials on Thursday said the event will still be held in person Jan. 5-8 with ""strong safety measures in place,"" which include vaccination requirements, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests.

The chips, in addition to getting denser, are also getting architecturally more complex, which presents a challenge for both chip designer and fabricator alike. Computer-aided design (CAD) software from US-based Synopsys not only allows circuits to be modelled down to their most microscopic elements but also offers the capability to verify their functionality and ease of manufacturing and to optimize the performance all virtually before the design is completed.”

Palm Capital mentioned Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q3 2021 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:

“Over the past few months, political and regulatory turmoil has caused sharp collapses in the share prices of certain Chinese companies and clients have been increasingly asking us why we don’t invest in the country.

When we’ve answered this question in the past, we’ve found it useful to use the example of Alibaba. On face value, Alibaba appears to be a phenomenal business. It is the world’s largest e-commerce company in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The marketplaces it operates are the most highly visited in China pointing to seemingly unassailable network effect advantages. These are solidified by its substantial investments and partnerships in an unrivalled logistics network. The company also has a crucial early mover advantage in cloud computing giving it a scale advantage that may quickly take it out of reach of competitors. And relative to its growth, the share often appears to be cheap.

However, if you dig beneath the surface, the investment case becomes less clear.

Alibaba’s accounting is questionable and murky, and its disclosure is poor. The company’s corporate structure is an intricate web of over 1,200 separate entities. And a staggering 890 of these entities were formed or acquired in the three years ending 2020. A large portion of its revenue growth each year is from consolidation of acquisitions with little disclosure of just how much. Significant entities appear and disappear from the company’s disclosures from year to year with no explanation. And almost three-quarters of the company’s total retained earnings since its 2014 IPO is from asset write ups with little explanation to back these up.”

4,2021-12-24T15:50:13+00:00,How Coinbase rode crypto’s ‘inflection point’ to a rocky but momentous year,"In 2021, Microsoft (MSFT) – Yahoo Finance’s company of the year – saw its market capitalization top $2 trillion.

During the year, the ascendant cryptocurrency asset class set two major milestones: its market cap also topped $2 trillion, and Coinbase (COIN), the most popular U.S. based crypto exchange, went public on the Nasdaq through the largest ever direct listing.

With a market cap of just over $70 billion, Coinbase’s value is just a fraction compared to tech heavyweights like Nasdaq, but is multiples higher than the $8 billion valuation it fetched only a few years before. That’s no small feat considering Coinbase Global CEO Brian Armstrong co-founded the company with Fred Ehrsam at a time when Bitcoin cost less than $10 (it traded above $50,000 on Friday).

“The industry had reached a critical inflection point,” Emilie Choi, Coinbase’s president and COO, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.

She added that in many ways, Coinbase’s entry into the public markets was reflective of the mainstream financial world’s acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies, and how the sector has matured since its birth over a decade ago.

The company’s stock rode a euphoric wave that reflected the frothiness of digital coins, where Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) price was setting record after record. Coinbase’s stock briefly touched $429 in its debut, briefly pushing its market value over $100 billion before it came back to earth.

Currently, the stock is down 45% or $90, trading at $238 per share from its debut high, weighed by a combination of factors: a deep crypto rout; China’s sudden decision to ban cryptocurrency mining; COVID-19 risk aversion; and head-spinning volatility stemming from the Federal Reserve’s looming rate hike campaign.

The momentous rise and precipitous drop from Coinbase’s debut price says a lot about the volatility in crypto, where fortunes are being made and lost at lightning speed. But it also explains why the firm performed so well over the past year, and why equity analysts see longer term issues with its current business model.

Short-term speculation in crypto comes with big risks and rewards. The digital coin boom has been both lucrative and devastating for small investors, and those outcomes shape Coinbase’s profit margins.

Story continues

The company’s core exchange business generates revenue from a percentage fee, or the “spread” charged on top of every user's trade. Based on its financials, Coinbase draws its best spreads from newer participants making smaller-retail sized trades on Coinbase’s platform.

Its Pro offering for institutions charges much cheaper transaction fees and also offers leverage.

On the day of Coinbase’s direct listing, revenue from trading fees accounted for 97% of the firm’s total revenue. As of the company’s latest earnings release in November, that percentage dipped to 89%. Of that figure, revenue from retail-sized orders accounted for 93.8% while much larger institutional customers made up only 6.2%.

In short, Coinbase generates most of its revenue during volatile but upward-trending market conditions, when crypto investor sentiment is at its highest.

That recipe has worked out for the company in 2021, but doesn’t bode well during sluggish periods of the market. During most of 2018 for example, newer retail-sized users tended to trade less often and institutional customers made a higher percentage of total trading volume.

It's during slow times that exchanges need to retain customer funds. All exchanges compete for customer assets under management. To incentivize customers to hold crypto, platforms been increasingly turning to creative methods to mimic the features of traditional asset classes — namely, the ability to pay customers interest on their holdings.

This is the heart of the current movement toward decentralized finance (DeFi), where investors earn way more from yields on crypto-based accounts than the average, low-yielding savings account.

But regulators are skeptical of these efforts, even when offered by centralized crypto firms. In September, Coinbase announced plans to offer customers a ""high-yield alternative to traditional savings accounts"" paying 4% on USD Coin, a stablecoin redeemable one-to-one for each U.S. dollar.

But the Securities and Exchange Commission abruptly intervened, claiming the offering amounted to a security, which would require registration and open a regulatory can of worms.

In a lengthy Twitter post at the time, Armstrong lashed out at what he called “really sketchy behavior” by regulators, but nevertheless, Coinbase bowed to the SEC’s concerns.

Instead, at the beginning of December, it launched a DeFi yield product for customers outside the U.S. –and its own financial returns from DeFi lending underscored why. During the quarter, Coinbase had grown its revenue from staking from $3.3 to $81 million over a single year.

Robinhood (HOOD) deals with a similar issue, but because it uses a payment for order flow (PFOF) model particular to stocks, its zero commission trading fees prevent competitors from offering better prices. And like Robinhood, the Coinbase model has its share of critics.

“I want them to diversify their revenue stream and be a broader crypto platform, not just trading,” Chris Bendler, managing director and senior equity analyst with D.A. Davidson Companies told Yahoo Finance. His critique echoed the opinion of other analysts covering the stock.

Coinbase’s current business model means that its share price acts almost like a “bellwether” for the crypto market, Bender explained. And since COIN’s debut, its value correlates very closely, on average by about 60%, to Bitcoin, D.A. Davidson’s research sows.

Devin Ryan, senior analyst and director of financial technology research with J.M.P. Securities, said that for Coinbase to be a long term success story, it needs “to see terminal growth in other aspects of its business model.”

If you’re bullish on bitcoin and the future of this blockchain-powered economy, then Coinbase is a great play.Chris Bendler, managing director, D.A. Davidson

Since going public, Armstrong and Choi have publicly signaled how the company is working to address these concerns, using their successful exchange business as the beginning of a larger play to build out the infrastructure of a rapidly expanding crypto market.

Ryan argued that the company’s exchange business positions Coinbase to be one of the best companies in the crypto space. It can build itself into an “Amazon of assets” as Armstrong stated during its Q2 earnings call, as well as a foundational company for the blockchain-built internet that crypto optimists envision.

Addressing the strategy, Coinbase has announced a bevy of new products and features for 2022, such as a platform devoted to the booming non-fungible token (NFT) movement, and Coinbase One, a monthly subscription trading service that waives commission fees in addition to enhanced features.

While not quite as convinced, D.A. Davidson’s Bendler argues that the correlation between COIN and the larger crypto market serves as a massive advantage when it comes to branding.

“It's almost like Xerox or Kleenex, when people think about trading crypto, they think Coinbase. It's a huge advantage for their cost of customer acquisition,” Bendler told Yahoo Finance.

Meanwhile, investors and analysts see Coinbase’s current leadership team as integral to its future. Ryan Selkis, Founder and CEO of Messari, recently argued in his firm’s end-of-year report that outside of Brian Armstrong, Choi is also “most responsible for the company’s ongoing success.”

It’s not hard to understand why. Choi, who joined Coinbase in 2018, is essential to helping the firm establish their infrastructure strategy.

She has spearheaded the company’s aggressive approach to mergers and acquisitions, which according to The Block Research, has included 5 companies this year, and 27 altogether – making Coinbase the most active crypto company in the M&A space. Notable acquisitions led by Choi include major custody provider Xapo (2019) and institutional trading firm Tagomi (2020), – both of which will increase service offerings to large institutional investors.

And the firm is positioning its earlier pickup of the infrastructure company, Bison Trails (now rebranded to Coinbase Cloud), as a blockchain hosting service provider for developers similar to Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS), the tech giant’s greatest money maker.

Though crypto purists might shy away from COIN simply because it’s underperformed BTC and ETH since its launch, D.A. Davidson’s Bendler said that many of the stock’s investors are “traditional fintech investors” who seek exposure to crypto with a growth story, at a reasonable price.

“It's not ridiculously expensive for what it is. If you’re bullish on bitcoin and the future of this blockchain-powered economy, then Coinbase is a great play,” Bendler added.

Billionaire Philippe Laffont is Selling These Stocks

10. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18

Percentage Decline in Stake: 100%

Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) is an electric car manufacturing company.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas boosted his price objective on Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) to $16 from $12 in November and kept an “Underweight” rating on the stock.

Overall, 18 hedge funds in the Q3 database of Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID).

While Laffont owns significant stakes in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) was offloaded by him in the third quarter.

9. Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (NYSE:LSPD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26

Percentage Decline in Stake: 100%

Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (NYSE:LSPD) is Montreal-based e-commerce and point-of-sale software firm.

Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (NYSE:LSPD) was upgraded to “Outperform” from “Sector Perform” by Scotiabank analyst Paul Steep in November, with a price objective of $103, down from $121. He believes the stock price reaction to the Q2 results was exaggerated.

In the third quarter of 2021, 26 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 867 funds held stakes in Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (NYSE:LSPD) compared to 29 funds in the previous quarter. Spencer M. Waxman's Shannon River Fund Management is Lightspeed Commerce Inc.’s (NYSE:LSPD) most significant stakeholder, with 210,000 shares worth $20.25 million.

8. Lemonade, Inc. (NYSE:LMND)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

Percentage Decline in Stake: 100%

Lemonade, Inc. (NYSE:LMND) is a holding company that specializes in the insurance industry.

In November, Jefferies analyst Yaron Kinar initiated coverage of Lemonade, Inc. (NYSE:LMND), rating the stock as “Underperform” and gave a price target of $49.

Lemonade, Inc. (NYSE:LMND) reported earnings for the third quarter in November, with an EPS of -$1.08, exceeding predictions by $0.08. In addition, the quarterly revenue of $35.7 million increased 100.6% year over year, exceeding nearly $2.18 million expectations.

At the end of the second quarter of 2021, billionaire Philippe Laffont had a $47.25 million stake in Lemonade, Inc. (NYSE:LMND). During the third quarter, he entirely sold off this stake.

Artisan Partners Limited Partnership, an asset management business, featured a few stocks in its Q4 2020 investor letter, and Lemonade, Inc. (NYSE:LMND) was one of them. Here is what the fund had to say:

“We also exited our investment in Lemonade. Lemonade is a digital-first insurance provider, offering both domestic and international homeowners and renters insurance. The company is disrupting its industry, having digitized the entire insurance experience—from client onboarding to claims—in order to build generational relationships with first-time insurance buyers. Using its app, the median time to receive a bindable renters insurance quote from Lemonade is less than two minutes, and the time for a homeowner’s quote is under three minutes. All claims are also filed through the Lemonade app, where a claims-specific bot can pay out applicable claims in as little as three seconds. The company’s longterm strategy is built upon acquiring customers cheaply today as they begin their adult life with the anticipation of growing future premiums as customer demands for insurance products naturally increase as they accumulate typically insured possessions—home and car purchases, travel, pets and providing coverage for beneficiaries in the event of an unforeseen death. We believe the addressable market is massive, particularly given the industry has largely resisted change, giving Lemonade a long runway to take share from weaker legacy competitors. That said, with shares appreciating above our PMV estimate, we exited our campaign.”

7. LegalZoom.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:LZ)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

Percentage Decline in Stake: 100%

LegalZoom.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:LZ) provides online legal services and solutions. Coatue Management had bought 20,281 of shares of LegalZoom.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:LZ) at the end of the second quarter. But the hedge fund sold off the stock completely in the third quarter

In its third-quarter 2021 investor letter, Cooper Investors mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Here is what Cooper Investors said:

“The other meaningful deal during the quarter was Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)’s acquisition of Mailchimp for $12bn. Intuit has reinvented itself over the last decade and thrived with a leadership position in QuickBooks Online, the financial accounting software for small businesses (effectively the ‘Xero of the US’). We originally invested in Intuit in February 2020, excited by the QuickBooks prospects.

Management have executed exceptionally well on the opportunity set which has seen the shares double since our initial purchase. However, the company has now conducted two meaningful deals in Mailchimp and Credit Karma worth a combined US$20bn over the last 12 months. The investment proposition has shifted from a focus on QuickBooks to now being a financial and small business software conglomerate. We continue to very much admire the company, but with Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) now trading on 50x forward earnings we no longer see such attractive latency on offer, nor the rewards for the level of execution risk and thus we have exited the position.”

November was not a good month for hedge funds, overshadowing an otherwise strong performance that stretched back to the early days of the pandemic. According to research firm PivotalPath, hedge funds were collectively down nearly 2% in November as the spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19 fueled market uncertainty. Hedge fund outlook was also affected by increased regulatory scrutiny on quant hedge funds in China that saw many firms scale back expansion plans and restrict inflows. In the past two years, the assets under management at these funds had jumped fivefold, per news publication Bloomberg.

However, the drip seems a temporary setback for the investment industry in the US as many firms have already positioned their portfolios for the upcoming macro economic environment. In 2021, hedge funds made some solid bets on companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) that are likely to pay handsome returns to them in the long-term. Some of the best performing stocks in this regard are discussed in detail below.

Our Methodology

10. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 16%

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has consistently beaten market expectations on earnings for the last several years, 11 times in the past 12 quarters to be exact. This year, the firm has raised guidance twice in three quarters. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has maintained high margins due to competitive positioning and analysts expect it to grow revenue further in the coming months. Even as growth stocks undergo a period of uncertainty due to inflation troubles, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is expected to weather the impact better than peers due to brand loyalty and an aggressive acquisition strategy.

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is also a favorite stock among hedge funds. Washington-based investment firmFisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) with 6.4 million shares worth more than $3.7 billion. Latest data shows that 95 funds with stakes worth $12.6 billion were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) at the end of September 2021.

Just like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the stocks on the radar of elite investors.

Here is what Polen Capital has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:

“Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk are both prime examples of the rotation that occurred during the quarter. Both are dominant businesses in their respective markets, which are experiencing structural tailwinds. Despite each business’s position of strength, the stocks of cyclicals and businesses with higher leverage and lower profitability were more favored this past quarter. In stark contrast, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk both have low leverage, high levels of profitability, high recurring revenues that mitigate cyclicality, and are both capital-light business models—all attributes we appreciate as investors. Adobe and Autodesk were also two of the top three performers within the Portfolio during 2020.”

9. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 17%

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock has been hit in recent weeks as the competition in the streaming industry heats up. However, some analysts believe that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can inflate subscriber numbers considerably by restricting password sharing or limiting the number of screens or devices per user. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is also far ahead of competition with regards to average revenue per user, a metric of more relevance to investors than subscribers.

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also has the advantage because it is more focused on streaming and innovation, where the parent companies of competitors, like Disney or Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), have core interests in other businesses. This is why hedge funds have been bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) this year despite misleading headlines.

106 funds out of 867 tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the end of the third quarter of 2021 worth $14.7 billion. Among these funds, Chicago-based Citadel Investment Group was a leading shareholder in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $2.6 billion.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“We purchased Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in March, initiating a 3% position in the Portfolio. We believe Netflix is a highly competitively advantaged company. It has recently met all our investment guardrails, and we anticipate it will remain sustainably above our guardrails over the next five years and beyond. We know Netflix for its ubiquitous streaming service and deep library of owned content. The company has made investments in this content (currently running at nearly $20 billion/year), generally keeping subscribers highly engaged and loyal to their service. The company has number one market share in 99% of markets globally, but it is our view that video streaming on-demand is still an underpenetrated space with many years of attractive growth likely ahead. The service is also relatively affordable at roughly $11/month on average globally.

We believe Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s growth in content spend is beginning to moderate, which could allow margin expansion to continue for many years when paired with ongoing subscriber growth and price increases. While there is competition from the likes of Apple (Apple TV+), Amazon (Prime Video), Disney (Disney+ and Hulu), and others, we believe there can be a handful of winners in this industry. Already, we see many people subscribe to multiple streaming video services, with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) being their “anchor” service. That said, the barriers to entry are high, and we believe they are getting higher given the substantial amount of capital and size of the subscriber base required to maintain a competitive service for both viewers and content producers. Over the next five years, we expect Netflix’s earnings growth to be approximately 30% annualized and free cash flow to grow at an even higher rate.”

8. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 22%

ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stock offers incredible growth opportunities at a very reasonable price considering the fact that over 85% of the companies which feature on the Fortune 500 use the products of the firm. Analysts expect ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to grow revenue at a rate of over 25% for the coming years. Investors can pick up the shares at a discounted price owing to the dip around growth companies in general at the market. The rise in share price of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has matched the pace of revenue growth and enables the stock to deal with an economic slowdown better than the competition.

Argus analyst Joseph Bonner recently raised the price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stock to $800 from $760 and kept a Buy rating, underlining that the increase in enterprise spending towards IT solutions was a long-term growth catalyst for the firm. The analyst also raised the FY2022 EPS estimates by 27c to $7.27.

Hedge funds have taken a similarly bullish position on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) this year. Connecticut-based investment firm Lone Pine Capital is a leading shareholder in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with 2.1 million shares worth more than $1.3 billion. At the end of September, 87 funds held stakes in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) worth $7.5 billion.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Palm Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“ServiceNow provides software solutions to structure and automate various task and processes for large businesses. The company began in 2004 with a solution to help businesses manage the IT services they offer employees and customers. Unlike the existing solutions in the market, ServiceNow’s offering was built using modern architecture that was flexible, modular, and user-friendly. And it left the incumbents – large companies such as BMC, IBM and MicroFocus – playing catch up.

As the company grew to dominate this market, it saw the opportunity to expand its offering to include the broader task of IT Operations Management – or the monitoring and control of an entire business’s IT infrastructure. And over time its success in improving productivity and user experience in IT resulted in customers asking the company to expand its offering into other business workflows including HR Management and Customer Services – which it has since done.

All ServiceNow’s applications (including those built by customers and third parties) are built on its ‘Now’ platform. This allows the company and its customers to innovate and deploy new solutions quickly. And it helps ServiceNow gather a large amount of data to gain insights into and use machine learning to build solutions to meet customer needs in other areas. Crucially, this platform can interface with other SaaS and legacy software services used by its customers. Not only does this allow an IT department to manage all the myriad software services used by a business from a single point of control, it also reduces the operational disruption risk for those transitioning from legacy software systems to the cloud.

Aside from the ease of use of ServiceNow’s offerings, the other factor driving its growth is that its ‘land and expand’ strategy starts in the IT department of customers – the very department whose task it is to recommend other software solutions for businesses. It is therefore no surprise that more than 75% of ServiceNow’s customers use more than one of its products and 80% of its new business is from existing clients.

The company now serves...”[read the entire letter here]

7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 248

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 22%

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) has had a whirlwind year, tackling user hacks, antitrust legislation, and rebranding in the space of a few months. It is remarkable that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) stock has still managed to register a respectable year-to-date gain despite these issues. As part of the rebrand effort, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) plans to spend nearly $70 billion till 2023 to pursue a multi-trillion dollar metaverse opportunity. It is one of the pioneers in this regard, although going back to the origins of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), this should not be unfamiliar territory.

At the end of the third quarter of 2021, 248 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey were long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) with stakes worth $38 billion. Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) with 7.5 million shares worth $2.5 billion.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“We continued to keep our learnings from 2020 in mind during the quarter as we sought to increase the up capture of the portfolio. We also made adjustments to the portfolio’s top 10 holdings to increase the participation of select stocks, including Facebook, while trimming our weighting to stable names, which now represent 47% of the portfolio. Our repositioning has been encouraging so far with the portfolio performing better on up days in the market while maintaining good down capture during more turbulent sessions.”

6. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 101

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 24%

Large-cap banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have staged a comeback at the market in the latter part of 2021 as inflation rises and investors prepare their portfolios for the inevitable hike in interest rates. This environment has been given further impetus by reports that share buybacks by S&P 500 firms could hit record highs in the coming months. Analysts point to greater EPS sensitivity, loan and dividend growth, and earnings upside as some of the catalysts for large-cap banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) heading into the new year.

Hedge funds with sizable stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) will benefit from the 20% potential upside in large-cap bank shares in 2022. One of these funds is Washington-based Fisher Asset Management, a leading shareholder in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) with 7 million shares worth more than $1.1 billion.

Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the stocks that hedge funds are buying.

In its Q4 2020 investor letter, Bretton Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“After a strong performance in 2019, we wrote this about our bank stocks in last year’s report: “There will be another recession sooner than later, and our banks will see larger loans losses, but we think this is more than priced into the stock, and our banks are well reserved for that eventuality.” Little did we know “sooner” really meant “a few weeks from now.” Despite the economic shock, the banks still have huge capital cushions that can absorb large loan losses. Our remaining bank investments, JPMorgan and Bank of America, increased their reserves significantly at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis in anticipation of imminent loan defaults, but with the government stimulus and perhaps a more resilient economy than many would have guessed, actual loan losses are up only slightly. They might happen later in 2021, but with an additional stimulus package and the vaccine rolling out, the large-scale losses may not be as bad as most people predicted. The bigger drag on the banks’ earnings power is lower rates, which in our opinion will persist for a long time. Despite this drag, we estimate both JPMorgan and Bank of America will continue to grow revenue and earnings over the next few years, while we believe their stocks remain bargains in a somewhat expensive market. JPMorgan’s earnings per share declined 17% last year, and its stock returned -5.5%. Bank of America’s earnings, which are more sensitive to interest rates, were down 32%, and its stock returned -11.6%.”

7,2021-12-24T13:06:41+00:00,"What is Web3, the new version of the internet everyone is talking about","If 2021 gave us anything, besides an endless pandemic, a supply chain crisis, inflation, and, well…you get it, it was the mainstreaming of the term Web3. A largely nebulous concept, Web3 is being trumpeted by crypto and blockchain boosters as the future of the internet.

The idea is to create a decentralized web, where users can transport their data from service to service without corporate walled gardens stopping them. It’s a soup of much-hyped tech terms ranging from NFTs to the metaverse that captured the attention of powerful venture capital firms.

But it’s also found critics in some big names including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who told The Babylon Bee on Wednesday that it “sounds like more marketing than reality.”

So is Web3 just jargon crypto bros are foisting on us? Or is it a new kind of internet that will change the world? The truth is, it’s a little of both.

Web3, the next frontier

Before we dive into the potential benefits and pitfalls of Web3, let’s go over why it’s called Web3. That name stems from Web1 or Web 1.0, the name for the original version of the internet that let you browse GeoCities sites or play silly Flash-based browser games. If you’re in your early 20s, this was essentially the Stone Age of the internet. Also, if you’re in your early 20s, I despise you for your youth.

Web2, otherwise known as Web 2.0, evolved from Web1 and featured the growth of social media platforms like Facebook, services like Uber and Venmo, and well, more or less everything that exists online today.

Web3, which I guess sounds cooler than Web 3.0, is the next evolution of the internet. An outgrowth of Web 2.0, it’s based on the idea that blockchain tech and digital tokens can foster a decentralized internet.

While Web 2.0 gave us the internet as we know it, it also brought heavy baggage. Just a handful of gargantuan companies control the web, whether that’s Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), or Facebook (FB), and they’re happy to keep it that way.

Big name tech companies also thrive on the data you give them. After all, Google and Facebook make the vast majority of their revenue from advertisements based on user information.

Web3, however, would allow sites and services to exist across decentralized computer networks and rely on blockchain technology to validate user data. The people who actually use sites and apps would then, ideally, own them. Participate in an online community enough, and you’d get a piece of it in the form of a digital token. Consumers, rather than a large corporation, would govern the service.

So where does the metaverse fit in?

Right, the metaverse. That’s the interconnected online worlds that everyone from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney have obsessed over. For the metaverse to exist as a group of expansive online worlds, you’ll need to seamlessly bring your user account, avatar, and data from place to place.

Individual companies owning various parts of the metaverse would likely make that impossible. Do you really think Meta is going to want to share its users with Roblox (RBLX) and Epic Games? No way.

That’s where the decentralized internet of Web3 comes in. If there’s no single entity controlling the sites and apps that make up the metaverse, users can jump from world to world with ease.

How would you pay for everything in Web3? With cryptocurrencies, of course. That has naturally brought crypto fans along for the ride.

The future of the internet

Web3 advocates will say the concept will be the dominant form of the internet going forward. But really, it’ll likely just be an amalgam of Web1, Web 2.0, and Web3.

Big Tech companies have already invested in Web3. Do you expect trillion-dollar companies that make up the larger internet ecosystem to give up their control? Come on.

The truth is Web3 isn’t some new version of the internet we’ll have to pack up and move to. It’s a growth of our current internet. And it’ll likely be a gradual transition that you hardly notice. After all, you don’t remember the moment we transitioned from Web1 to Web 2.0. Right?

And while there’s the potential for innovative changes like giving people more control over the services they visit the most, I wouldn’t expect the utopian paradise Web3 boosters promise.

Yes, the internet will soon change, but it’s not as though it hasn’t been changing this entire time.
