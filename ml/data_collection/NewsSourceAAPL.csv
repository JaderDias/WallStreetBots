5,2021-12-24T16:09:48+00:00,Apple Gets Dutch Antitrust Order to Open Up App Payments,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was ordered by the Dutch antitrust authority to allow dating apps to use other payment systems or face a fine of as much as 50 million euros ($56 million).

Apple imposes “unreasonable conditions” by not allowing a free choice for app payments besides Apple’s in-app purchases, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets said in a press release. It must make changes by Jan. 15 or face a fine of 5 million euros a week, with a total limit of 50 million euros.

The iPhone maker’s refusal to let app developers steer customers to other ways of paying has been targeted by lawsuits and antitrust investigations across the world. Apple charges a commission of as much as 30% on some app subscriptions, although the U.S. firm reduced the fees for smaller developers last year.

In September Apple was ordered by a U.S. District Judge to give developers the option of bypassing its commission on in-app purchases, including letting iOS apps use “buttons, external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing methods” other than Apple’s payment system. Apple earlier this month won a reprieve to the ruling.

The EU also stepped up a case over payment curbs earlier this year and the U.K. is also looking at in-app purchase rules.

“Some app providers are dependent on Apple’s App Store, and Apple takes advantage of that dependency,” said Martijn Snoep, the head of the Dutch authority. “Apple needs to take seriously the interests of app providers too, and set reasonable conditions.”

Apple disagrees with the order and has filed a legal challenge, the company said in an emailed statement.

The Cupertino, California-based company “has invested tremendous resources helping developers of dating apps reach customers and thrive on the App Store, and has the right under EU and Dutch law to charge developers of these apps a fee for all the services and technologies Apple provides them.”

The Dutch authority initially ruled against Apple in August but was unable to publish its decision after Apple challenged it at court. A Friday court ruling allowed the authority to go public.

Apple's practice of requiring app developers to use its in-app payment system and pay commissions of 15% to 30% on digital goods purchases has come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world.

An investigation by the Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) on whether Apple's practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019. But it was later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps, including Tinder owner Match Group Inc.

""We disagree with the order issued by the ACM and have filed an appeal,"" Apple said in a statement. It added that ""Apple does not have a dominant position in the market for software distribution in the Netherlands, has invested tremendous resources helping developers of dating apps reach customers and thrive on the App Store.""

Reuters reported in October https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-dutch-watchdog-finds-apple-app-store-payment-rules-anti-competitive-2021-10-07 that the ACM had found Apple's practices anti-competitive and ordered changes, but the decision was not published until Friday.

The regulator's decision said Apple violated competition laws. It has ordered Apple to adjust the unreasonable conditions in its App Store that apply to dating-app providers.

The decision orders Apple to allow dating-apps providers to use alternative payment systems. The company faces a fine of up to 50 million euros ($56.6 million) if it fails to comply.

Apple was given until Jan. 15 to implement changes, a statement said.

""We applaud the ruling issued today by a Rotterdam Court affirming the ACM's decision that Apple's forced use of its in-app payment systems and other practices violate Dutch and EU competition law, and must be eliminated by January 15th,"" Match group said in an email statement.

The disclosure of Apple's regulatory setback in the Netherlands comes after the iPhone maker lost a fight in South Korea to stop a law that requires major app platform providers like Apple and Alphabet Inc's Google to allow developers to use third-party payment services.

Google has indicated it will allow such payments https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-plans-allow-third-party-payments-systems-skorea-2021-11-04, though it will still charge a commission on them. Apple has not commented on its plans for compliance in Korea.

Apple is facing proposed legislation in the European Union and United States that would force it to change its in-app payment policies and other business practices objected to by developers.

November was not a good month for hedge funds, overshadowing an otherwise strong performance that stretched back to the early days of the pandemic. According to research firm PivotalPath, hedge funds were collectively down nearly 2% in November as the spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19 fueled market uncertainty. Hedge fund outlook was also affected by increased regulatory scrutiny on quant hedge funds in China that saw many firms scale back expansion plans and restrict inflows. In the past two years, the assets under management at these funds had jumped fivefold, per news publication Bloomberg.

However, the drip seems a temporary setback for the investment industry in the US as many firms have already positioned their portfolios for the upcoming macro economic environment. In 2021, hedge funds made some solid bets on companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) that are likely to pay handsome returns to them in the long-term. Some of the best performing stocks in this regard are discussed in detail below.

Hedge Funds Were Right About These Stocks

10. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 16%

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has consistently beaten market expectations on earnings for the last several years, 11 times in the past 12 quarters to be exact. This year, the firm has raised guidance twice in three quarters. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has maintained high margins due to competitive positioning and analysts expect it to grow revenue further in the coming months. Even as growth stocks undergo a period of uncertainty due to inflation troubles, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is expected to weather the impact better than peers due to brand loyalty and an aggressive acquisition strategy.

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is also a favorite stock among hedge funds. Washington-based investment firmFisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) with 6.4 million shares worth more than $3.7 billion. Latest data shows that 95 funds with stakes worth $12.6 billion were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) at the end of September 2021.

Just like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the stocks on the radar of elite investors.

Here is what Polen Capital has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:

“Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk are both prime examples of the rotation that occurred during the quarter. Both are dominant businesses in their respective markets, which are experiencing structural tailwinds. Despite each business’s position of strength, the stocks of cyclicals and businesses with higher leverage and lower profitability were more favored this past quarter. In stark contrast, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk both have low leverage, high levels of profitability, high recurring revenues that mitigate cyclicality, and are both capital-light business models—all attributes we appreciate as investors. Adobe and Autodesk were also two of the top three performers within the Portfolio during 2020.”

9. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 17%

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock has been hit in recent weeks as the competition in the streaming industry heats up. However, some analysts believe that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can inflate subscriber numbers considerably by restricting password sharing or limiting the number of screens or devices per user. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is also far ahead of competition with regards to average revenue per user, a metric of more relevance to investors than subscribers.

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also has the advantage because it is more focused on streaming and innovation, where the parent companies of competitors, like Disney or Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), have core interests in other businesses. This is why hedge funds have been bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) this year despite misleading headlines.

106 funds out of 867 tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the end of the third quarter of 2021 worth $14.7 billion. Among these funds, Chicago-based Citadel Investment Group was a leading shareholder in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) with 4.3 million shares worth more than $2.6 billion.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“We purchased Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in March, initiating a 3% position in the Portfolio. We believe Netflix is a highly competitively advantaged company. It has recently met all our investment guardrails, and we anticipate it will remain sustainably above our guardrails over the next five years and beyond. We know Netflix for its ubiquitous streaming service and deep library of owned content. The company has made investments in this content (currently running at nearly $20 billion/year), generally keeping subscribers highly engaged and loyal to their service. The company has number one market share in 99% of markets globally, but it is our view that video streaming on-demand is still an underpenetrated space with many years of attractive growth likely ahead. The service is also relatively affordable at roughly $11/month on average globally.

We believe Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s growth in content spend is beginning to moderate, which could allow margin expansion to continue for many years when paired with ongoing subscriber growth and price increases. While there is competition from the likes of Apple (Apple TV+), Amazon (Prime Video), Disney (Disney+ and Hulu), and others, we believe there can be a handful of winners in this industry. Already, we see many people subscribe to multiple streaming video services, with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) being their “anchor” service. That said, the barriers to entry are high, and we believe they are getting higher given the substantial amount of capital and size of the subscriber base required to maintain a competitive service for both viewers and content producers. Over the next five years, we expect Netflix’s earnings growth to be approximately 30% annualized and free cash flow to grow at an even higher rate.”

8. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 22%

ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stock offers incredible growth opportunities at a very reasonable price considering the fact that over 85% of the companies which feature on the Fortune 500 use the products of the firm. Analysts expect ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to grow revenue at a rate of over 25% for the coming years. Investors can pick up the shares at a discounted price owing to the dip around growth companies in general at the market. The rise in share price of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) has matched the pace of revenue growth and enables the stock to deal with an economic slowdown better than the competition.

Argus analyst Joseph Bonner recently raised the price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stock to $800 from $760 and kept a Buy rating, underlining that the increase in enterprise spending towards IT solutions was a long-term growth catalyst for the firm. The analyst also raised the FY2022 EPS estimates by 27c to $7.27.

Hedge funds have taken a similarly bullish position on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) this year. Connecticut-based investment firm Lone Pine Capital is a leading shareholder in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with 2.1 million shares worth more than $1.3 billion. At the end of September, 87 funds held stakes in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) worth $7.5 billion.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Palm Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“ServiceNow provides software solutions to structure and automate various task and processes for large businesses. The company began in 2004 with a solution to help businesses manage the IT services they offer employees and customers. Unlike the existing solutions in the market, ServiceNow’s offering was built using modern architecture that was flexible, modular, and user-friendly. And it left the incumbents – large companies such as BMC, IBM and MicroFocus – playing catch up.

As the company grew to dominate this market, it saw the opportunity to expand its offering to include the broader task of IT Operations Management – or the monitoring and control of an entire business’s IT infrastructure. And over time its success in improving productivity and user experience in IT resulted in customers asking the company to expand its offering into other business workflows including HR Management and Customer Services – which it has since done.

All ServiceNow’s applications (including those built by customers and third parties) are built on its ‘Now’ platform. This allows the company and its customers to innovate and deploy new solutions quickly. And it helps ServiceNow gather a large amount of data to gain insights into and use machine learning to build solutions to meet customer needs in other areas. Crucially, this platform can interface with other SaaS and legacy software services used by its customers. Not only does this allow an IT department to manage all the myriad software services used by a business from a single point of control, it also reduces the operational disruption risk for those transitioning from legacy software systems to the cloud.

Aside from the ease of use of ServiceNow’s offerings, the other factor driving its growth is that its ‘land and expand’ strategy starts in the IT department of customers – the very department whose task it is to recommend other software solutions for businesses. It is therefore no surprise that more than 75% of ServiceNow’s customers use more than one of its products and 80% of its new business is from existing clients.

The company now serves...”[read the entire letter here]

7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 248

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 22%

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) has had a whirlwind year, tackling user hacks, antitrust legislation, and rebranding in the space of a few months. It is remarkable that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) stock has still managed to register a respectable year-to-date gain despite these issues. As part of the rebrand effort, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) plans to spend nearly $70 billion till 2023 to pursue a multi-trillion dollar metaverse opportunity. It is one of the pioneers in this regard, although going back to the origins of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), this should not be unfamiliar territory.

At the end of the third quarter of 2021, 248 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey were long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) with stakes worth $38 billion. Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) with 7.5 million shares worth $2.5 billion.

In its Q1 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“We continued to keep our learnings from 2020 in mind during the quarter as we sought to increase the up capture of the portfolio. We also made adjustments to the portfolio’s top 10 holdings to increase the participation of select stocks, including Facebook, while trimming our weighting to stable names, which now represent 47% of the portfolio. Our repositioning has been encouraging so far with the portfolio performing better on up days in the market while maintaining good down capture during more turbulent sessions.”

6. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 101

Year-to-Date Gain in Share Price: 24%

Large-cap banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have staged a comeback at the market in the latter part of 2021 as inflation rises and investors prepare their portfolios for the inevitable hike in interest rates. This environment has been given further impetus by reports that share buybacks by S&P 500 firms could hit record highs in the coming months. Analysts point to greater EPS sensitivity, loan and dividend growth, and earnings upside as some of the catalysts for large-cap banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) heading into the new year.

Hedge funds with sizable stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) will benefit from the 20% potential upside in large-cap bank shares in 2022. One of these funds is Washington-based Fisher Asset Management, a leading shareholder in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) with 7 million shares worth more than $1.1 billion.

Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the stocks that hedge funds are buying.

In its Q4 2020 investor letter, Bretton Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“After a strong performance in 2019, we wrote this about our bank stocks in last year’s report: “There will be another recession sooner than later, and our banks will see larger loans losses, but we think this is more than priced into the stock, and our banks are well reserved for that eventuality.” Little did we know “sooner” really meant “a few weeks from now.” Despite the economic shock, the banks still have huge capital cushions that can absorb large loan losses. Our remaining bank investments, JPMorgan and Bank of America, increased their reserves significantly at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis in anticipation of imminent loan defaults, but with the government stimulus and perhaps a more resilient economy than many would have guessed, actual loan losses are up only slightly. They might happen later in 2021, but with an additional stimulus package and the vaccine rolling out, the large-scale losses may not be as bad as most people predicted. The bigger drag on the banks’ earnings power is lower rates, which in our opinion will persist for a long time. Despite this drag, we estimate both JPMorgan and Bank of America will continue to grow revenue and earnings over the next few years, while we believe their stocks remain bargains in a somewhat expensive market. JPMorgan’s earnings per share declined 17% last year, and its stock returned -5.5%. Bank of America’s earnings, which are more sensitive to interest rates, were down 32%, and its stock returned -11.6%.”

With the Fed printing massive amounts of money, price levels are rising at a rate we haven’t seen in decades.

In November, U.S. consumer prices increased 6.8% on a year over year basis, the fastest pace since June 1982.

If you’re hoarding cash, spiking inflation means your savings won’t be able to buy the same amount of products and services as before.

Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike.

In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two characteristics that help companies thrive amid high inflation: an ability to increase prices easily and an ability to take on more business without having to spend too much.

In other words, invest in asset-light businesses with pricing power.

Here are three Berkshire holdings that fit the description — plus one asset that may always be in demand no matter how high consumer prices climb.

American Express (AXP) RYO Alexandre/Shutterstock

American Express demonstrated its pricing power quite recently as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 all the way to $695.

The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment.

American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.

In fact, business is already booming, as the company’s revenue jumped 25% year-over-year to $10.9 billion in Q3.

American Express is the third-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway, only behind Apple and Bank of America. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth over $24 billion.

Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.

Yes, American Express trades at over $160 per share. But you can get a smaller piece of the company using a popular app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.

Coca-Cola (KO) Elvan/Shutterstock

Coca-Cola is a classic example of a so-called “recession-proof” business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a simple can of Coke is still affordable to most people.

The company’s entrenched market position also gives it some pricing power. Besides, Coca-Cola can always rely on a trick it’s used in the past: keeping its prices the same but subtly reducing its bottle size.

Factor in its iconic brand portfolio and the fact that its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories, and it’s easy to see why Coca-Cola fits nicely in a long-term portfolio.

After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago. It has survived — and thrived — in many periods of high inflation.

Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $23.1 billion.

Apple (AAPL) Thanes.Op/Shutterstock

No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro would call it a steal, but consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.

Earlier this year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones.

While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying as much about a drop in sales volume.

Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing more than 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value.

One of the reasons behind that concentration is the sheer increase in the tech giant’s stock price. Over the past five years, Apple shares have surged more than 500%.

Remember, if you don’t want to pick individual tech stocks after the sector’s massive bull run, you can always build a diversified portfolio automatically just by using your “spare change.”

A 'finer' way to hedge? Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock

A word of caution: Stocks often correlate with each other. So in a market sell-off, even the most solid blue-chip companies are likely to tumble.

The good news? Stocks aren’t the only asset that has the potential to beat inflation.

Check out fine art, for instance.

Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% during the same period, according to the Citi Global Art Market Chart.

More importantly, this “real” physical asset has very little correlation with the stock market.

According to Deloitte’s latest Art & Finance Report, 85% of wealth managers believe art should be included as part of a wealth management service.

But the question is how to do it and deal with the challenges.

It’s true that investing in fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra-rich, like Buffett. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks too, just like Jeff Bezos and Peggy Guggenheim.
